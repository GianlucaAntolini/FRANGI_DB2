# FRANGI_DB2

This project consists of creating a RDF graph that stores informations about viral Spotify songs and their Youtube Video (if it exists). We include also informations about the artists, the albums and the generes of the songs and also other useful informations.

We first designed and created the ontology for the data using Proteg√®, then we created the RDF graph using RDFlib library for Python and we eventually wrote some queries that retrieve some useful/interesting data and statistics from the database.

**Datasets**:

**Info**

 - Steps/order to generate the data to be imported in GraphDB:  
      - run dataMergeScript.ipynb  
      - run loadSYData.ipynb  
 - As number of streams we took the maximum value when there were multiple values for the same video. We generated top level genres and subgenres by looking at the names of all the genres.  
 - The datasets (in the Datasets/Original folder) have been merged in a single file called complete_dataset.csv (in the Datasets/Computed folder). To create this file we created a script called dataMergeScript.ipynb in which we match the Spotify track ids of the songs and keep the information from both files.
 - Here are the paths of the main files:
      - The base ontology is under "Ontology/syOntololgy.ttl"
      - The computed turtle file with the data is under "Datasets/rdf/syOn.ttl"
      - The queries (with description and code) are under "Queries/SPARQL_queries.pdf"
